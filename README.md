# RT-DETR Training

This repository contains a minimal example for training a Real-Time Detection Transformer (RT-DETR) model using PyTorch. The main script is `train_rtdetr.py` which demonstrates loading the COCO dataset and training a simplified RT-DETR model.

```
python train_rtdetr.py --data-path /path/to/coco --epochs 10 --batch-size 2
```

The provided `RTDETRModel` is a placeholder. For real experiments, replace it with an actual implementation from an RT-DETR library or your custom model definition.
